It is a must-have for fans of the Darksiders series and anyone who appreciates video game art. The book is available for purchase from Amazon.com[^1^] or Udon Entertainment's website[^2^].

The Darksiders series is known for its many different directions, as each game features a different Horseman of the Apocalypse and a different gameplay style. In 2019, THQ Nordic and Airship Syndicate released Darksiders Genesis, a spin-off prequel game that introduces the fourth and final Horseman, Strife, as well as co-op gameplay for the first time in the franchise's history.
 
Darksiders Genesis is a top-down hack and slash action role-playing game that can be played solo or with a friend. The player can switch between Strife and War at any time, or each player can control one of them in co-op mode. Strife uses dual pistols and agile moves, while War uses a sword and brute force. The game features a variety of enemies, puzzles, secrets, and boss battles, as well as a skill tree and a creature core system that allows the player to customize their abilities and stats.
 
The game's story takes place before the events of the original Darksiders, and follows Strife and War as they are sent by the Charred Council to investigate Lucifer's schemes in Hell. Along the way, they encounter familiar characters from the series, such as Samael, Vulgrim, and Abaddon, as well as new foes and allies. The game's tone is more humorous than previous entries, with Strife providing comic relief and witty banter with War.
 
The Art of Darksiders Genesis is a 200-page hardcover book that collects the concept art and illustrations of the game. The book features artwork of Strife and War, as well as their weapons, gear, enemies, environments, and cinematics. The book also includes commentary from the developers at Airship Syndicate and THQ Nordic, as well as a foreword by Joe Madureira. The book is available for purchase from Amazon.com[^1^] or Udon Entertainment's website[^2^].
