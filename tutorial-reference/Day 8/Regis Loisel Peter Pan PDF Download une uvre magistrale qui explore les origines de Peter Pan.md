# How to Download Regis Loisel's Peter Pan PDF for Free
 
If you are a fan of Peter Pan, the classic character created by J.M. Barrie, you might be interested in reading a different version of his story. Regis Loisel, a French comic book artist and writer, has created a six-volume series that explores the origins and adventures of Peter Pan in a dark and realistic way. Loisel's Peter Pan is not a children's book, but a mature and gritty tale that deals with themes such as poverty, violence, sexuality, and magic.
 
Loisel's Peter Pan was originally published in French between 1990 and 2004, and has been translated into several languages, including English. The English edition was published by Soaring Penguin Press in 2014, and it contains all six volumes in one hardcover book. However, if you want to read Loisel's Peter Pan online or on your device, you might have a hard time finding a legal and free PDF download.
