## How to Create Custom Campaigns
 
To create custom campaigns, you will need the campaign editor that comes with the game. You can access it by clicking on "Tools" in the main menu and then selecting "Campaign Editor". The campaign editor will open a new window where you can create and edit scenarios.
 
A scenario is a single map that contains all the elements of a mission, such as terrain, units, objectives, triggers, etc. A campaign is a collection of scenarios that are linked together by a story. You can create as many scenarios and campaigns as you want, but you will need to save them in the correct folders for the game to recognize them.

The default folder for custom campaigns is `C:\Program Files (x86)\LucasArts\Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds\Game\Campaign`. You can also create subfolders for different categories or themes. For example, you can create a folder called `Star Wars Movies` and save your scenarios based on the films there.
 
To create a new scenario, click on "File" and then "New". You will be asked to choose a civilization for each player. You can have up to eight players in a scenario, but only one of them can be human-controlled. The rest will be controlled by the computer. You can also choose the map size, terrain type, starting age, resources, population limit, and victory conditions.
 
Once you have set up the basic parameters of your scenario, you can start editing the map. You can use the toolbar on the left side of the screen to place units, buildings, resources, gaia objects (such as animals or trees), sounds, effects, and more. You can also use the menu on the top of the screen to access more options and tools.
 
One of the most important features of the campaign editor is the trigger system. Triggers are events that happen when certain conditions are met. For example, you can create a trigger that plays a sound when a unit enters a certain area, or that changes the diplomacy between two players when an objective is completed. Triggers can make your scenarios more dynamic and interactive.
 
To create a trigger, click on "Scenario" and then "Triggers". A new window will open where you can add, edit, or delete triggers. Each trigger has three components: name, condition, and effect. The name is just a label that helps you identify the trigger. The condition is what needs to happen for the trigger to activate. The effect is what happens when the trigger activates.
 
For example, let's say you want to create a trigger that plays a sound when a unit enters a certain area. You would name the trigger something like "Sound Trigger", then choose "Bring Object To Area" as the condition. You would then select the unit and the area on the map. Finally, you would choose "Play Sound" as the effect and select the sound file you want to play.
 
You can create as many triggers as you want for your scenario. You can also use variables and timers to make your triggers more complex and flexible. For more information on how to use triggers, you can check out [this tutorial](https://swgb.heavengames.com/scendesign/advanced/triggers).
