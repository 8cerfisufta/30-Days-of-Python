Fantasies was released on April 7, 2009 and debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart. It also peaked at No. 76 on the Billboard 200 and sold 76,000 copies in the United States as of October 2009[^2^]. The deluxe edition of Fantasies included five bonus tracks: "Help I'm Alive (Acoustic)", "Help I'm Alive (The Twelves Remix)", "Gimme Sympathy (Adam Freeland Remix)", "Stadium Love (Angelo Spencer Et Les Hauts Sommets Remix)" and "Front Row (Acoustic)".
 
The bonus track in the file is not one of these official bonus tracks, but rather a fan-made remix of "Front Row", the last song on the original album. The remix adds some electronic beats and synthesizers to the acoustic version of the song, creating a contrast between the soft vocals and the upbeat music. The remix is titled "Front Row (Deluxe Edition Bonus Track)" and has a duration of 4:17 minutes.
