If you are looking for a realistic and immersive simulation of the Airbus A318-A321 family of aircraft, you might want to check out the Airbus Xtreme Prologue package from BlackBox Simulation. This add-on is compatible with Microsoft Flight Simulator X, Prepar3D v2, v3 and v4, and FSX Steam Edition. It offers four highly detailed models with CFM or IAE engines, a fully functional virtual cockpit with switchable MFD screens and ECAMS, a custom flight management system with SIDs, STARs, airways and alternate airports, and many more features that will make you feel like a real Airbus pilot.

The Airbus Xtreme Prologue is not a finished product yet, but rather a preview of what to expect from the full Airbus Xtreme V1.00 release that is planned for later this year. The Prologue version 0.85.2 still has some limitations and missing features, such as weather radar, some MCDU functions, some ECAM pages and system status, and some cockpit animations. However, it also offers regular service updates that will gradually improve the simulation and add more functionality. The Prologue version costs â¬42.99 (about $48.70) and it will give you a discount for the full version when it comes out.
 
The Airbus Xtreme Prologue package is available for immediate download from the BlackBox Simulation website[^1^] or from SimShack[^2^]. You can also find more information and reviews on the AVSIM forum[^3^]. If you are a fan of Airbus aircraft and want to experience a fly-by-wire marvel that is one of the most successful aircraft in civil aviation history, you should give this add-on a try.

The Airbus Xtreme Prologue package comes with a variety of liveries for each model, representing airlines from all over the world. You can also download more liveries from the BlackBox Simulation website or from other sources. The liveries are well done and realistic, with accurate colors and logos. The external models also feature many animations, such as landing gears, flaps, spoilers, thrust reversers, doors, and cargo bays. The wing flex and engine fan blades are also animated and look smooth and natural.
 
The virtual cockpit is one of the highlights of this add-on. It is very detailed and realistic, with high-resolution textures and 3D gauges. Every switch, knob, lever and dial is modeled and animated, and most of them are functional. The cockpit lighting is also very good, with separate dimmer controls for each panel. The MFD screens and ECAMS are switchable and show various information about the flight and the systems. The MCDU is custom made and allows you to program a complete flight plan with all the necessary parameters. The autopilot panel (FCU) is also fully functional and easy to use.
 
The sound effects are another strong point of this add-on. They are recorded from real Airbus aircraft and sound very authentic. You can hear the engine sounds change according to the thrust level and the speed. You can also hear the cockpit sounds, such as switches, alarms, warnings, and callouts. The sound quality is very good and adds to the immersion.
 
The flight dynamics are based on real Airbus data and tested by real Airbus pilots. The aircraft behave realistically according to their weight, balance, speed, altitude, and weather conditions. The fly-by-wire system is simulated and provides protection against stalls, overspeeds, overloads, and bank angles. The aircraft are easy to fly manually with a joystick or a yoke, but they also respond well to the autoflight system. The performance is also good, with no significant impact on the frame rates or the stability of the simulator.
 
In conclusion, the Airbus Xtreme Prologue package from BlackBox Simulation is a very good add-on for FSX/P3D users who want to fly the Airbus A318-A321 family of aircraft. It offers high-quality models with many features and options that will satisfy both casual and hardcore simmers. It is not a perfect product yet, as it still has some limitations and missing features that will be added in future updates. However, it is a very promising product that shows a lot of potential and dedication from the developer. If you are interested in this add-on, you can buy it now and enjoy it as it is, or wait for the full Airbus Xtreme V1.00 release that will offer even more realism and functionality.
