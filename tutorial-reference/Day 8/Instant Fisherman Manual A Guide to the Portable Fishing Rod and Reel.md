## How to Use Your Instant Fisherman 2
 
The Instant Fisherman 2 is easy to use and set up. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Unfold the rod by pressing the button on the handle and pulling the rod tip out.
2. Adjust the length of the rod by twisting the locking collar clockwise or counterclockwise.
3. Open the bail arm of the reel by lifting it up.
4. Thread the line through the guides on the rod, starting from the smallest one near the tip.
5. Tie your hook, lure, or bait to the end of the line using your preferred knot.
6. Close the bail arm of the reel by pushing it down.
7. Set the drag knob on the reel according to the size and strength of the fish you are targeting. The drag knob controls how much pressure is applied to the line when a fish pulls on it. To increase the drag, turn the knob clockwise. To decrease the drag, turn it counterclockwise.
8. You are ready to cast your line and start fishing. To cast, hold the rod with your dominant hand and use your index finger to hold the line against the rod. With your other hand, hold the handle of the reel. Swing the rod back over your shoulder and then forward over your head. As you swing forward, release your index finger and let go of the line. The line will fly out with your hook or lure attached.
9. To retrieve your line, turn the handle of the reel clockwise. You can vary the speed and direction of your retrieve to attract different fish.
10. If you feel a bite or a tug on your line, set the hook by lifting the rod tip up quickly and firmly. Then reel in your catch while keeping tension on the line.
