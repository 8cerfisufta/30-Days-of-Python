The Holland Code instrument, also known as the RAISEC test, is a tool that helps you explore your personality and career interests. It was developed by John Holland, a psychologist who studied how people's personalities relate to their work environments. He proposed that there are six main personality types that can be used to describe your preferences and motivations. These types are realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising and conventional. Each type has its own strengths, weaknesses and compatible occupations. Your Holland code is a combination of two or three of these types that best represent your personality. For example, if you are artistic, social and enterprising, your Holland code would be ASE. The Holland code can help you identify careers that match your personality and increase your satisfaction and success at work. The Holland code is also the foundation for other career assessment instruments, such as the Strong Interest Inventory and the Self-Directed Search, which measure your interests and skills in relation to different occupations. If you want to learn more about the Holland code and how to apply it to your career planning, you can consult some of the books that explain and interpret the Holland code system. Some of these books are 50 Best Jobs for Your Personality (Jist Works, 2012), which lists the most suitable jobs for each personality type based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor; Dictionary of Holland Occupational Codes (Psychological Assessment Resources, 1996), which provides detailed descriptions of over 12,000 occupations and their corresponding Holland codes; and CareerCode: Know Your Code, Find Your Fit (Amazon Digital Services, 2012), which offers a simple and practical guide to finding your ideal career based on your Holland code.
