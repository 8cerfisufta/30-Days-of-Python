Bhaag Milkha Bhaag also showcases some of the remarkable achievements of Milkha Singh in his illustrious career. He was the first Indian to win a gold medal in the Commonwealth Games in 1958, when he clocked 46.6 seconds in the 440 yards race in Cardiff. He also won two gold medals in the 1958 Asian Games in Tokyo, in the 200 metres and 400 metres events. He repeated his feat of winning two gold medals in the 1962 Asian Games in Jakarta, in the 400 metres and 4 Ã 400 metres relay events.
 
However, Milkha Singh's most memorable race was the one he lost by a whisker. In the 1960 Olympics in Rome, he participated in the 400 metres final, where he was leading the race until the last 100 metres. He made a mistake of looking back at his opponents, which slowed him down and allowed three runners to overtake him. He finished fourth with a time of 45.73 seconds, which was a new national record that stood for almost four decades. The race was so close that it required a photo finish to decide the winner, who was Otis Davis of the United States with a time of 45.07 seconds.
 
Milkha Singh's life story is not only about his achievements on the track, but also about his resilience and courage in overcoming adversity. He lost his parents and siblings during the partition of India and Pakistan, and had to flee from his village to save his life. He faced poverty and hardship in his early years, and even spent some time in jail for travelling without a ticket. He joined the Indian Army as a recruit, where he discovered his talent for running. He trained hard and persevered to become one of India's greatest athletes and an inspiration for generations to come.
