The TMS Unicode Component Pack is a set of controls that enable you to create applications that can handle Unicode characters and texts on Windows operating systems that support Unicode. Unicode is a standard for encoding and displaying characters from different languages and scripts. With these controls, you can use Delphi, C++Builder or Windows 95/98/ME to develop Unicode applications for Windows NT/2000/XP/2003/2008/Vista/7.NOTE: These controls do not add Unicode functionality to Windows 95/98/ME. They will run on any 32-bit version of Windows, but they will only use Unicode on Windows NT/ 2000/ XP/ 2003/ Vista/ 7.Some features of the TMS Unicode Component Pack are:You can edit and view Unicode properties and values in the Delphi/C++Builder object inspector.You can show Unicode hints for your controls and components.You can use Unicode actions to perform tasks on your application.You can work with different input methods (IMEs) for entering and editing Unicode texts.You can support locales that use only Unicode characters.You can save and load WideString properties on forms without losing data.

The TMS Unicode Component Pack includes several controls that can display and edit Unicode texts, such as TUniEdit, TUniMemo, TUniRichEdit, TUniListBox, TUniComboBox, TUniTreeView and TUniStatusBar. These controls have similar properties and methods as the standard VCL controls, but they can handle Unicode characters and texts. You can also use the TUniCanvas and TUniPrinter classes to draw and print Unicode texts on any device context.
  
The TMS Unicode Component Pack also provides some helper classes and functions that make it easier to work with Unicode strings and texts in your code. For example, you can use the TntStrings class to store and manipulate Unicode strings in a TStringList-like object. You can also use the WideFormat, WideCompareStr, WideUpperCase and other functions to perform common operations on Unicode strings. You can also use the TntSystem class to access system information and settings that are related to Unicode.
  
The TMS Unicode Component Pack is compatible with a wide range of Delphi and C++Builder versions, from Delphi 7 to Delphi XE8 and from C++Builder 2006 to C++Builder XE8. You can use these controls to create applications for Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP/2003/2008/Vista/7. However, you need to have a Windows operating system that supports Unicode to fully benefit from the features of these controls. If you want to create applications that can run on any Windows operating system and still use Unicode, you may want to check out the TMS Unicode Component Pack for FireMonkey.
