If you are curious about the plot of Abar Byomkesh, here is a brief summary of the story. The film is based on the novel Chitrochor by Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay, which is one of the many adventures of Byomkesh Bakshi and his friend Ajit Banerjee.
  
The story is set in 1932 in the Chinabazar area of Kolkata, where Byomkesh Bakshi, a private detective, goes undercover as Atul Chandra Mitra to investigate a series of murders. He stays in a mess with his wife Satyabati and Ajit, and meets several Bengali residents who are connected to the case.
  
The mystery begins when a group photograph of the residents is stolen from Mahidhar Chaudhury's house. Byomkesh learns that the same photograph is missing from everyone else's possession as well. He suspects that someone is trying to erase his identity from the picture.
  
Soon after, an artist named Falguni Pal, who can paint anyone's portrait in minutes, is killed in Umanath Ghosh's house. Byomkesh finds out that Falguni had painted a portrait of the killer before his death. He also discovers that two of the residents, Ashwini Ghatak and Adinath Shome, are in love with Rajani, Mahidhar's daughter.
  
Byomkesh follows the clues and uncovers the truth behind the murders. He reveals that the killer is Amaresh Raha, a banker who had embezzled money from his bank and used a fake beard to disguise himself. He had killed Falguni to prevent him from exposing his real face. He had also killed another resident, Nakuleshwar, who had recognized him from the photograph.
