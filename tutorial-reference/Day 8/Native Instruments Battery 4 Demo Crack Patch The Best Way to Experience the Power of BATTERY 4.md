### Creating and Editing Drum Kits
 
One of the main features of Battery 4 is the ability to create your own custom drum kits from scratch or from the existing library. You can load up to 128 cells in a kit, each containing a sample, a MIDI note, and various parameters. You can also assign colors, tags, and names to each cell for easy identification and organization.
 
To create a new kit, simply click on the "+" icon on the top left corner of the interface. A new empty kit will appear with 16 cells. You can add more cells by clicking on the "+" icon on the bottom right corner of each cell. To load a sample into a cell, you can either drag and drop it from your computer or from the browser on the right side of the interface. The browser lets you search and browse through the library of sounds by categories, tags, or keywords.
 
To edit a sample in a cell, you can use the waveform display on the bottom of the interface. Here you can adjust the start and end points, volume envelope, pitch envelope, loop mode, and more. You can also use the knobs on the top of the interface to control the volume, pan, tune, and tone of each cell. To access more advanced editing options, you can click on the "Edit" tab on the top right corner of the interface. Here you can adjust parameters such as filter, saturation, compression, EQ, modulation, and more.
 
### Applying Effects
 
Battery 4 also comes with a powerful effects section that lets you apply up to four effects per cell, four effects per bus, and four effects per master output. You can choose from a variety of effects such as EQ, compressor, reverb, delay, distortion, chorus, flanger, phaser, and more. You can also use convolution reverb to add realistic room ambience to your drums.
 
To apply an effect to a cell, simply drag and drop it from the browser on the right side of the interface to one of the four slots below the cell. To apply an effect to a bus or master output, drag and drop it to one of the four slots on the bottom left corner of the interface. You can also use the "Send" knob on each cell to send a portion of its signal to one of the four buses for parallel processing.
 
To edit an effect's parameters, click on its name on the slot. A window will pop up with all the available controls for that effect. You can also use automation or MIDI learn to assign any parameter to a MIDI controller for real-time manipulation.
 
### Integrating Battery 4 with Your DAW
 
Battery 4 can be used as a standalone application or as a plug-in in your DAW of choice. To use it as a plug-in, simply load it as an instrument track in your DAW and select it as your MIDI input device. You can then play and record your drums using your MIDI keyboard or pad controller.
 
To integrate Battery 4 with your DAW's mixer and routing system, you can use multiple outputs to send each cell or bus to a separate audio track in your DAW. This way you can apply additional effects or processing to each drum sound individually or in groups. To enable multiple outputs in Battery 4, click on the "Output" tab on the top right corner of the interface. Here you can assign each cell or bus to one of the 16 stereo outputs available. You can also rename each output for easier identification.
 
To enable multiple outputs in your DAW, you need to follow different steps depending on your DAW's specifications. For example, in Logic Pro X you need to create an auxiliary channel strip for each output in Battery 4 and select it as its input source. In Ableton Live you need to create an audio track for each output in Battery 4 and select it as its input source. For more details on how to set up multiple outputs in your DAW, please refer to
