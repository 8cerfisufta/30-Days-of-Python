This error can be caused by various factors, such as corrupted system files, invalid CA certificate, insufficient permissions, or antivirus interference. In this article, we will show you some possible solutions to fix this error and activate Radmin successfully.
 
## Solution 1: Use a valid CA certificate
 
To be able to activate Radmin successfully, you will need to use a valid CA certificate. If you have not yet installed a CA certificate for your IDM, you will need to download the IDM CA certificate from the appropriate download page on Freedr web site. Please keep in mind that you need to install the CA certificate on your computer and not on the IDM server.
 
After installing the CA certificate, you can try to run the keymaker tool again and see if the error is resolved.
 
## Solution 2: Run the keymaker tool as administrator
 
Another possible reason for the error is that you don't have enough permissions to execute files in the temporary directory. To fix this, you can try to run the keymaker tool as administrator. To do this, right-click on the keymaker.exe file and select "Run as administrator". Then follow the on-screen instructions to activate Radmin.
