## Step 1: Download Indian Tabla Styles
 
There are many sources online where you can find Indian tabla styles for Yamaha keyboards. One of them is [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/ragatala-com/sets/yamaha-tabla-styles-3), where you can listen to and download some tabla styles created by RagaTala[^1^]. They have styles for various models of Yamaha keyboards, including PSR S710, S910, S550, S650, S950, A2000, etc. You can visit their website [www.ragatala.com](http://www.ragatala.com) to download more styles.
 
Another source is [Yamaha India](https://in.yamaha.com/en/products/contents/keyboards/vse/indian_2/index.html), where you can download the Indian2 Voices and Styles Pack[^2^]. This pack contains many Indian voices and styles suitable for professional live performance and studio applications. You can enjoy the sounds of classic movie soundtracks using styles such as Movie Ballad, Khemta, and Sentimental Ballad. You can also find voices such as Super Sitar, Nadaswaram, Veena, Bansuri, Kashmir Santoor, and more.
 
To download the Indian2 Voices and Styles Pack, you need to use the Yamaha Expansion Manager (YEM) software. You can find the instructions on how to use YEM on the Yamaha India website. You can also find other voices and styles packs on the same website.
 
## Step 2: Transfer Indian Tabla Styles to Your Keyboard
 
Once you have downloaded the Indian tabla styles that you like, you need to transfer them to your Yamaha PSR 550 keyboard. There are two ways to do this: using a USB flash drive or using a MIDI cable.
 
If you are using a USB flash drive, you need to copy the style files (usually with .sty extension) to the root directory of your flash drive. Then, insert the flash drive into the USB port of your keyboard. Press the [FUNCTION] button on your keyboard, then select [USB] from the menu. You should see a list of style files on your flash drive. Select the one that you want to use and press [ENTER]. The style will be loaded into your keyboard memory.
 
If you are using a MIDI cable, you need to connect your keyboard to your computer using the cable. Make sure that both devices are turned on and that your computer recognizes your keyboard as a MIDI device. Then, use a software program such as MIDI-OX or Style Works XT to send the style files from your computer to your keyboard. You can find more details on how to use these programs online.
 
## Step 3: Play Indian Tabla Styles on Your Keyboard
 
Now that you have loaded the Indian tabla styles into your keyboard memory, you can start playing them on your keyboard. Press the [STYLE] button on your keyboard, then select one of the style numbers that correspond to the style that you have loaded. For example, if you have loaded a style into style number 001, press [STYLE], then [0], [0], [1]. The style name will appear on the display.
